# bitfinexleaderboardTracker
Tracks the position of two publicly known traders on BFX

Uses Bitfinex Exchange API to get information about the leaderboard, which allows to track traders about their position and profits. The code is very unorganized as I wanted to get it done asap and know what is being done during these market crashes.
Additionally it posts the results into a desired discord server.


Requirements to get started: 1) 'PATH' of bitfinexHistory.txt in bitfinexLeaderboard.js file
                             2) 'yourBotToken' , your discord Bots token in discMain.js file

Simply type '!whale' in the discord channel
                             

required modules: discord.js, discord.js-commando , request , fs ,readline
